We're migrating all HTTP vals to a new runtime. Vals on the old runtime are
labeled "HTTP (deprecated)" in the UI.

For a comprehensive guide on migrating your HTTP vals, please refer to our
[Migration Checklist](#migration-checklist).

The new runtime executes code slightly differently, which will impact a very small number of vals.
Here's what you need to know:

### Accidentally re-using values.

Previously, HTTP vals executed all code for each request, generating new values
every time. For example, this val would return a different random number on each
request:

```ts val
const randomValue = Math.random();
export default async function (req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  return Response.json({ randomValue });
}
```

```bash
curl https://std-rand.web.val.run # => {"randomValue":0.35380812508500936}
                                  # => {"randomValue":0.48797154766298423}
                                  # => {"randomValue":0.31486102144764216}
```

Our new runtime reuses Deno processes between requests when possible. This means
values defined outside the request handler will be shared across requests:

```bash
curl https://std-rand.web.val.run # => {"randomValue":0.22669880732624748}
                                  # => {"randomValue":0.22669880732624748}
                                  # => {"randomValue":0.22669880732624748}
```

To fix this, you can move the call to `Math.random()` inside the request
handler.

```ts val
export default async function (req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const randomValue = Math.random();
  return Response.json({ randomValue });
}
```

This will generate a new random value on every request, and return a new random
value, just like before.

```bash
curl https://std-rand.web.val.run # => {"randomValue":0.7862069462810053}
                                  # => {"randomValue":0.33484196890793516}
                                  # => {"randomValue":0.7272455873033288}
```

### Intentionally caching values for performance!

Sometimes, you may want to reuse values across requests for performance reasons.
The new runtime's behavior can be advantageous in these scenarios. You can
initialize values or perform expensive operations outside the request handler,
and they'll be cached between requests:

```ts val
// Expensive initialization or data fetching
const expensiveData = await fetchLargeDataset();
const cache = new Map();

export default async function (req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const url = new URL(req.url);
  const key = url.searchParams.get("key");

  if (cache.has(key)) {
    return Response.json({ data: cache.get(key) });
  }

  const result = expensiveComputation(key, expensiveData);
  cache.set(key, result);

  return Response.json({ data: result });
}
```

In this example:

1. `fetchLargeDataset()` is called only once when the val is initialized, not on
   every request.
2. We create a `cache` Map that persists between requests.
3. The request handler checks the cache first, potentially saving computation
   time.
4. If the result isn't cached, it performs the computation and stores the result
   for future requests.

This approach can significantly improve performance for repeated requests or
when dealing with expensive initializations. However, be mindful of memory
usage, as cached data will persist in memory until the val is restarted.

### Migration Checklist

When migrating your HTTP vals to the new runtime:

1. Review your code for any variables declared outside the request handler.
2. Determine if these variables should be regenerated for each request or if
   they can be safely cached.
3. Move variables that need to be unique per request inside the handler
   function.
4. Consider opportunities to improve performance by intentionally caching
   expensive computations or initializations.
5. Test your val thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected under the new
   runtime.
