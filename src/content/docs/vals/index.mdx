Vals are collaborative folders of deployed code.

- **Runnable Files:** Any `.js`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file is hosted and runnable
- *Logs and traces**: Debug with logs, grouped by execution trace
- **Multiple Triggers:** Add [HTTP](/vals/http), [Cron](/vals/cron), and [Email](/vals/email) triggers to any file in a val
- **Import:** Import from other vals, NPM, and more [↗](../reference/import/)
- **Visibility:** Set val code as public, unlisted, or private [↗](../reference/permissions/)
- **Versioned Workspace:** Automatic version tracking and [pull requests](./pull-requests).
- **Static Files:** Include HTML, CSS, Markdown, etc (_binary file support coming soon_)
- **[Environment variables](../reference/environment-variables):** Store secrets and configuration securely

## Triggers

There are **3 types of triggers** that files within a val can have:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="HTTP"
    description="Triggered by https requests. You can make APIs or websites"
    href="/vals/http"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Cron"
    description="Triggered by a timer or cron expression"
    href="/vals/cron"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Email"
    description="Triggered by an incoming email"
    href="/vals/email"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Collaboration

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Branches"
    description="Create branches for feature development, testing, and sharing"
    href="./branches"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Remixes"
    description="Remix another user's val to make changes and send a pull request"
    href="./remixes"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Pull Requests"
    description="Merge changes from a branch or remix back into the parent val"
    href="./pull-requests"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Limitations

- Maximum files per val: 1000
- Maximum branches per val: 100
- Binary files are not supported. We recommend [Blob Storage](/std/blob).
- Free tier users are limited to 5 private or unlisted vals. Pro users can have unlimited private vals. All users can have unlimited public vals.
