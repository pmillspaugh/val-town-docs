Vals are collaborative folders of deployed code that run instantly with no setup. 

You can combine multiple file types and execution triggers for anything from simple scripts to complex applications. 

Triggers are like inputs or connections to the outside world that cause a val to run. A trigger could be [HTTP](/vals/http), which makes the val serve a website, or [Cron](/vals/cron), which runs the val periodically, or [Email](/vals/email), which lets the val receive incoming emails.

## Val features

- **Runnable Files:** Any JavaScript/TypeScript file is hosted and runnable.
- **Multiple Triggers:** Add [HTTP](/vals/http), [Cron](/vals/cron), and [Email](/vals/email) triggers to any file in a val.
- **Import:** Import other vals, NPM, and more [↗](../reference/import/).
- **Visibility:** Set vals as public, unlisted, or private [↗](../reference/permissions/).
- **Versioned Workspace:** Automatic version tracking for files, folders, and READMEs.
- **Relative Imports:** Use standard relative paths (e.g., `../bar/foo`).
- **Static Files:** Include HTML, CSS, Markdown, etc.
- **Environment Variables:** Scoped [environment variables](../reference/environment-variables) support.

## Triggers
There are **3 types of triggers** that files within a val can have:
<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="HTTP"
    description="Triggered by https requests. You can make APIs or websites"
    href="/vals/http"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Cron"
    description="Triggered by a timer or cron expression"
    href="/vals/cron"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Email"
    description="Triggered by an incoming email"
    href="/vals/email"
  />
</CardGrid>


## Collaboration

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Branches"
    description="Create branches for feature development, testing, and sharing"
    href="./branches"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Remixes"
    description="Remix another user's val to make changes and send a pull request"
    href="./remixes"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Pull Requests"
    description="Merge changes from a branch or remix back into the parent val"
    href="./pull-requests"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Limitations

- Maximum files per val: 1000
- Maximum branches per val: 100
- Binary files are not supported. We recommend [Blob Storage](/std/blob).
- Free tier users are limited to 5 private or unlisted vals. Pro users can have unlimited private vals. All users can have unlimited public vals.
