**Remixes are Val Town Projects’ version of Forks**.

Forks exist for vals and work similarly to Remixes for Projects, just without the extra collaboration features.

Remixes are a way to create a copy of a Project in your account while maintaining references to the original. They can be used for cross-account collaboration. Changes in a remix can be merged back via [pull requests](../pull-requests).

### Remixing

Remixing creates a copy of a project in your account while maintaining references to the original. This process includes the main branch even when a non-main branch is remixed to maintain consistency.

### Merging

A remix can only be merged into its parent if there are no conflicts. All edits are copied to the parent project, and the version is updated to match the latest version in the parent.

### Limitations

You cannot have two projects with the same name in the same account. This means that you cannot remix a project if you already have a project of that name. It also means that you can't remix a project twice, and that you can't remix your own project. We are working on fixing this.
