import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

Cron triggers let you schedule code to run repeatedly on a schedule. 

Some common examples include:
- Checking an RSS feed every hour
- Getting notified when a website updates
- Sending a reminder email every morning

Crons can be configured with [cron syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), or simple intervals like "once an hour"

Functions can run up to once every 15 minutes, or [once a minute, with the Pro plan](https://www.val.town/pricing).

## Type Signature

Crons take an `Interval` object as a parameter, and can return anything as a result. The return value is ignored.

```tsx title="Example" val
export function cronValHandler(interval: Interval) {
  console.log("Cron val ran!");
}
```

The Interval type has the following shape:

```ts
interface Interval {
  lastRunAt: Date | undefined;
}
```

## Schedule types

There are two kinds of schedules: either simple intervals, like "run every two hours",
or you can use cron syntax to define more complex schedules.

You can consult [crongpt.com](https://crongpt.com) for help on writing cron expressions.
For example the following cron runs every two hours, on the first day of the month:

```
0 */2 1 * *
```

:::note[Crons run in UTC]

Cron expressions are always evaluated in the [UTC timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time),
so if you want to specify a certain hour in your local timezone, you may need to adjust
the cron expression.

## Example

This example polls an RSS feed for new items since the last run. This val runs every 1 hour.
