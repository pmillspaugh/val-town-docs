import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

Val Town supports server-rendered JSX. This lets you use JSX syntax to construct
your HTML string. It does not include any client-side JSX framework features,
such as re-rendering on the client, but you can string that together yourself
by writing client-side vals.

To use JSX, you'll need to insert what TypeScript calls a
"[per-file pragma](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsxImportSource)" - a
comment that uses `@jsxImportSource` to specify where the JSX methods are going
to come from. For example, if you're implementing JSX with Preact, the pragma
will look like this at the top of your file:

```tsx
/** @jsxImportSource https://esm.sh/preact */
```

### Preact

A good default is [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), which provides a
nice `preact-render-to-string` module that lets you quickly turn that JSX object
into a string that you can use for a response.

:::tip[Interoperability]

Deno has JSX and TypeScript support, but browsers do not. But you
can still use your vals in browsers and systems that don't support
these technologies when you use the [esm.town module endpoint](/api/esm-town) because we automatically transpile their code.
