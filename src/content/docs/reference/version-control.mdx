title: Version Control
description: Every time you save a val it creates a new immutable version in the
  version history.

Vals are immutable, but you can publish new versions of vals. Versions start at
`0` and go up from there. When you reference a val, you always get the most
recent version. You can toggle which version you're looking at via the dropdown
menu next to the val's name.

## Imports & pinning

Vals are imported via esm.town URLs. If you leave off the version number, it's an unpinned import, and you'll get the latest version _at the time_, which our lockfile will freeze so that your code runs consistently even if newer versions of the imported file might include breaking changes. If you include a version number, it's a pinned import, and you'll always get that version.

```ts title="Unpinned val import"
import { myVal } from "https://esm.town/v/username/valname";
```

```ts title="Pinned val import"
import { myVal } from "https://esm.town/v/username/valname?v=7";
```

When you import one of your own vals, via the `@` helper, it will be imported unpinned, so you will
automatically get all new changes. When you import another user's val via `@`,
it will pin your import to the most recent version of that val
(ie it will end it `?v=7` or whatever the current version number is),
so if they change it, you won't get automatic updates.

This makes your code more stable and protects you against
code injection attacks. You can override this default behavior if you trust the
user not to break your code: remove the `v` query param in the import statement,
and your code will always use the latest version of that val.

### Versions of external imports

You can also specify versions of NPM modules by using an `@` symbol:

```ts
import { min } from "npm:lodash-es@4.17.21";

// Or you can specify a version range, like
// you would in a package.json file:
import { min } from "npm:lodash-es@4";
```

We highly recommend pinning imported modules because their APIs can
change between versions and unexpectedly break your code.

### Lockfiles

When you save a Val we generate a
[deno.lock](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/modules/integrity_checking/)
lockfile. This pins all versions of your dependencies and also calculates hashes
to verify that the content of a dependency does not change.

When you save a Val, we regenerate the lockfile from scratch, re-pinning your
unpinned dependencies to whatever their current versions are at that new time.

Additionally, when you save a val, we find all the vals in your account that
depend on that val and mark their lockfiles for regeneration. That way you can
keep rapidly iterating and we'll make sure to update dependency relationships in
your vals.

You can also use a [lockfile import map](https://www.val.town/v/maxm/lockfileImportMap) if you need to make sure your val frontend and backend are always in sync.
